I wrote this code back in 1996, before the invent of online servers and server
queues.  It was ment to be a command-line IRC like chat room where people
could queue up for Quake games and chat with thier friends while they waited.

Of course this is completely obsolete today, but I'm putting the code out
there for posterity, if no other reason.
