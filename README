I hope this will be of some use to you and all I ask is that you please
send me some email when you make any major changes or enhancements to this
project so that I can keep track of its progress.  I would like to continue
with the development of this project myself as well, but alas real life has
a tendancy to interfere.  *sigh*

If you have any questions, comments, or news of what you have done with
this source, please feel free to email me at donovan@mindspring.com.

Enjoy!
